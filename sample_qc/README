common_filters - lists of participants I do/don't expect to include in analyses
scripts - all the code. Generates the common filters, and the runs
runs - output of different batches of sample qc (with different criteria,
	and so different end sample lists)
primus_test - some tests I wrote to verify primus ran correctly
