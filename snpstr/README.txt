Data is from the paper
A reference haplotype panel for genome-wide imputation of short tandem repeats,
Saini, et al, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06694-0 

I downloaded the files from here:
http://gymreklab.com/2018/03/05/snpstr_imputation.html

Saini_etal_SuppTable2.txt as referred to on that website is also called supplementary
dataset 1 in the nature paper. 
The first sheet of the excel file is the .txt file, and the second is the _key.txt file

If you download SuppTable3/dataset 2, note that it is tructated and doesn't contain
alleles fter part way through chrom 7

igsr_samples.tsv contains information about the samples in this 
haplotype panel. It was downloaded from the 1000 genomes project
data portal main page (https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample)
