This directory contains the phenotypes we have access to through UKB
Doesn't consist of bulk data (microarray data, exomes, imaging, etc.)
This data is all stored in the .csv file, with the .html file
documenting what's there.

Read below for an explanation of how these files were downloaded/produced

The instructions for downloading these are described here:
https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~bbdatan/Accessing_UKB_data_v2.1.pdf
(The accessing data guide here: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/exinfo.cgi?src=AccessingData)
in section 2
Only someone with the email from the original application
(i.e. Richard Yannicky in the Gymrek lab) can download the .enc file that is the
encoded file containing all of the data
The ukbunpack and ukbconv utilities can be used to generate the .csv (or other
datafiles from the .enc file

To do this:
cd to the directory with the .enc file, and set $UKB_UTILITIES to the 
appropriate directory.
Also, set the following so that the utilities will work on tscc:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SOURCE/glibc/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(SOURCE=/projects/ps-gymreklab/resources/source)
Unpack the enc into a enc_ukb file by running:
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbunpack ukb29170.enc $UKB_UTILITIES/k29170.key
This will generate a ukb29170.enc_ukb file
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb docs -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the documentation for the dataset (ukb29170.html)
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb csv -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the csv
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb bulk -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
creates the bulk data file that's used to download
bulk data sets (such as the exome data BAM files)

The ukb29170.log and fields.ukb are generated as side effects of the above
commands

You can retrieve subsets of the data or output the data in different
formats using different options with ukbconv, see the linked PDF above

all_fields.csv was downloaded from some part of the showcase website
that I didn't document

request_2020_march contains the temporary files I generated while creating
a list of data fields to request from the UKB administration at that date

scripts contains random helper scripts I've written
