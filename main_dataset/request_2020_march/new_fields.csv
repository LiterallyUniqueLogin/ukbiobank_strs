6362	First code array presented	The tests were described by an outer array of 32 symbol-digit arrays each containing the digits 0-7. To present some element of unpredictability between participants, each run of the program chose a random starting point in the outer array and presented tests from that point onwards (looping back to the origin if required). The outer array was zero-indexed, so that a value of 0 in this field means that the first symbol-digit array was used for the Coding array. <p> To illustrate, suppose a participant was allocated the value 5 for their start array. Then round 1 would use Array 4 [values 4,5,1,3,7,2,6,0] for the Code and Array 5 [3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7] for the Test. Round 2 would still use Array 4 for the Code but Array 6 [6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1] for the test etc. <p>The test arrays are listed below, and also in ~C500~ with the symbol dictionary shown in ~R111~. <p> 0) 5,0,3,6,1,2,4,7 <br> 1) 1,3,5,7,4,6,0,2 <br> 2) 4,5,6,7,3,0,2,1 <br> 3) 1,4,6,7,2,3,0,5 <br> 4) 4,5,1,3,7,2,6,0 <br> 5) 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7 <br> 6) 6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1 <br> 7) 1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3 <br> 8) 3,4,2,5,6,0,7,1 <br> 9) 2,5,3,0,7,1,6,4 <br> 10) 3,6,4,1,0,5,7,2 <br> 11) 5,3,2,0,4,1,7,6 <br> 12) 2,3,4,1,7,5,0,6 <br> 13) 4,3,1,5,2,0,6,7 <br> 14) 3,5,0,1,4,7,2,6 <br> 15) 4,2,1,0,6,7,5,3 <br> 16) 0,2,3,7,1,4,6,5 <br> 17) 7,1,2,4,0,6,5,3 <br> 18) 5,1,7,3,2,4,0,6 <br> 19) 7,6,4,5,0,2,3,1 <br> 20) 2,6,1,4,5,7,0,3 <br> 21) 4,0,6,1,3,7,5,2 <br> 22) 5,6,0,7,3,2,1,4 <br> 23) 6,5,1,3,0,4,7,2 <br> 24) 4,1,7,2,5,6,3,0 <br> 25) 5,2,0,6,7,4,1,3 <br> 26) 3,0,5,6,7,2,4,1 <br> 27) 3,2,5,4,7,0,6,1 <br> 28) 0,6,7,5,1,2,3,4 <br> 29) 4,3,1,0,6,5,2,7 <br> 30) 5,4,6,7,1,0,2,3 <br> 31) 0,4,7,2,3,1,5,6 <p>The first round (attempts 0-7) used a constant fixed pattern [2,4,6,1,3,5,7,0] for the Code Array and [7,1,5,4,6,0,3,2] for the test Array for all participants.
6364	Vocabulary level	This is the final estimate of the participant's vocabulary level, at the end of the test. It ranges between -11 (most basic) and 11 (most complex) . ~F6365~ gives the Standard Error associated with this estimated value.

20153	Forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1), predicted	Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1-second (FEV1), was calculated using a subset of "healthy never smokers" from UK Biobank. "Healthy never smokers", were selected as individuals with "Ever Smoking Status"=0 and with "Reproducible measure using the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) Criteria"=YES (1), with the following exclusions: <ul> <li> ~F2316~: Individuals who indicated that they had experienced wheeze: "Yes" (1), "Do not know" (-1) or "Prefer not to answer" (-3). </li> <li> ~F6152~: Individuals who reported "emphysema/chronic bronchitis" (6) or "asthma" (8) or "Prefer not to answer" (-3). </li> <li>~F20002~: Individuals who reported any of the following: asthma (1111), COPD (1112), emphysema/chronic bronchitis (1113), bronchiectasis (1114), interstitial lung disease (1115), asbestosis (1120), pulmonary fibrosis (1121), fibrosing/unspecified alveolitis (1122), respiratory failure (1124), pleurisy (1125), spontaneous/recurrent pneumothorax (1126), other respiratory problems (1117). </li> </ul> Healthy never smokers were grouped into 58 age-sex bands (29 age bands per sex; ages 39, 40 and 41 were grouped into one band and ages 69, 70 and 72 were grouped into one band with ages 42 to 68 each forming a separate band) and the following linear regression model was fitted in each age-sex band: <p>FEV1 = <i>Beta0</i> + <i>Beta1</i> * Standing Height <p> Predicted FEV1 was then calculated for all samples who were never smokers ("Ever Smoking Status"=0) or heavy smokers ("Ever Smoking Status"=1 AND "Pack years as proportion of life span exposed to smoking" &gt;= 0.42) and with "Reproducible measure using the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) Criteria"=YES, using the estimates of <i>Beta0</i> and <i>Beta1</i>, from the appropriate age-sex band: <p>Predicted FEV1= (pred.<i>Beta0</i>) + (pred.<i>Beta1</i>)^ * Standing Height <p> Five individuals were outliers in terms of their FEV1 and were not coded. <p> This derived data field has come from Professor Martin Tobin at the University of Leicester.
20154	Forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1), predicted percentage	This value was only calculated for samples with non-missing predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1-second, using derived variables Force Expiratory Volume in 1-second (FEV1) and predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1-second (pred.FEV1). It is defined as the Force Expiratory Volume in 1-second divided by the Percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1-second multiplied by 100: <p>FEV1 /pred.FEV1 * 100 <p> This derived data field has come from Professor Martin Tobin at the University of Leicester.
20155	Interval between previous point and current one in alphanumeric path (trail #2)	These timings were made using Javascript Date.getTime() running in a web-browser on the participants own equipment, and researchers should read ~R501~ before making use of this data. Timings which have obviously been affected by the issues discussed have been flagged as Invalid.
20156	Duration to complete numeric path (trail #1)	Derived by summing the values in ~F20149~. <p> Where some of the individual timings were flagged as Invalid, the total duration was calculated by interpolating from the valid timings.
20157	Duration to complete alphanumeric path (trail #2)	Derived by summing the values in ~F20155~
20158	DXA images	Contains the DXA image set as generated by the scanning device. <br> Includes whole body; lateral thoraco-lumbar spine; right and left hips; right and left knees .
20159	Number of symbol digit matches made correctly	This is the number of times a participant correctly matched a symbol with a digit summed across all the rounds of the test that they performed, excluding the initial 8 items corresponding to the training round.
20160	Ever smoked	Derived using variables "Current tobacco smoking" (~F1239~) and "Past tobacco smoking" (~F1249~). <p>Individual classed as Eversmoker if Current tobacco smoking= most days (1) or occasionally (2) OR Past tobacco smoking= most days (1) or occasionally (2) or tried once or twice (3). <p> Individual were classed as Neversmoker if Current tobacco smoking= no (0) AND Past tobacco smoking= never (4). <p> Individuals who answered to either question "Do not know" (-1) "Prefer not to answer" (-3) and "None of the above" (-7) were not coded. <p> This derived data field has come from Professor Martin Tobin at the University of Leicester.
20161	Pack years of smoking	Pack years calculated for individuals who have ever smoked according to data field Ever smoking status=1, using appropriate data: Current cigarette (either manufactured or hand rolled) smokers who smoke most days (smoking data fields used: ~F3436~ and ~F6183~). Past cigarette (either manufactured or hand rolled) smokers who smoked most days (smoking data fields used: ~F2867~, ~F2897~ and ~F2887~). Current cigar/pipe smokers who smoked most days and previously smoked cigarettes (smoking data fields used: ~F3436~, ~F6194~ and ~F6183~). The general definition of a pack year is the number of cigarettes smoked per day, divided by twenty, multiplied by the number of years of smoking. The number of years of smoking is calculated by substracting the age of starting smoking from the age smoking was stopped. <p> Number of cigarettes per day / 20 * (Age stopped smoking - Age start smoking) <p>The figure is adjusted for individuals who gave up smoking for more than 6 months, according to data fields 2907 or 3486 by subtracting six months from the number of years of smoking. <p>Number of cigarettes per day / 20 * (Age stopped smoking - Age start smoking - 0.5) <p>Note: Individuals who started and gave up smoking before 16 years of age were coded as NA. For individuals who started smoking before 16 but gave up after 16, their age start was set as 16. Individuals who reported starting and stopping smoking at the same age and reported giving up smoking for more than 6 months had pack-years set at 0. <p> This derived data field has come from Professor Martin Tobin at the University of Leicester.
20162	Pack years adult smoking as proportion of life span exposed to smoking	Average number of pack-years smoked by an individual each year, over their adult lifetime, calculated using pack-years data field. Pack years as a proportion of lifespan exposed to smoking is defined as pack years divided by the number of years between the participants' age at recruitment and the age of 16: <p> Pack years / (Age at recruitment - 16) <p> This derived data field has come from Professor Martin Tobin at the University of Leicester.

20191	Fluid intelligence score	This is a simple unweighted sum of the number of correct answers given to the 13 fluid intelligence questions. Participants who did not answer all of the questions within the allotted 2 minute limit are scored as zero for each of the unattempted questions.
20192	Number of fluid intelligence questions attempted within time limit	This is the number of fluid intelligence questions attempted within time limit (maximum 14). Participants were allowed to answer whichever question they were doing when the timer expired but the result was not counted towards the score in ~F20191~.
20193	FI14 : alphanumeric substitution	Question : "If 'Anne' is thirty-four and 'John' is forty-seven, what number is 'that'? <br> Is it: 49,50,51,52,53" <p> This question was not asked in the original touchscreen version.
20195	Number of symbol digit matches attempted	This is the number of symbol digit combinations which a participant attempted to match, excluding the initial 8 items corresponding to the training round.
20196	First code array presented	The tests were described by an outer array of 33 symbol-digit arrays each containing the digits 0-7. To present some element of unpredictability between participants, each run of the program chose a random starting point in the outer array and presented tests from that point onwards (looping back to the origin if required). The outer array was zero-indexed, so that a value of 0 in this field means that the first symbol-digit array was used for the Coding array. <p> To illustrate, suppose a participant was allocated the value 5 for their start array. Then round 1 would use Array 5 [values 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7] for the Code and Array 6 [6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1] for the Test. Round 2 would still use Array 5 for the Code but Array 7 [1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3] for the test etc. <p>The test arrays are listed below, and also in ~C500~ with the symbol dictionary shown in ~R111~. <p> 0) 5,0,3,6,1,2,4,7 <br> 1) 1,3,5,7,4,6,0,2 <br> 2) 4,5,6,7,3,0,2,1 <br> 3) 1,4,6,7,2,3,0,5 <br> 4) 4,5,1,3,7,2,6,0 <br> 5) 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7 <br> 6) 6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1 <br> 7) 1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3 <br> 8) 3,4,2,5,6,0,7,1 <br> 9) 2,5,3,0,7,1,6,4 <br> 10) 3,6,4,1,0,5,7,2 <br> 11) 5,3,2,0,4,1,7,6 <br> 12) 2,3,4,1,7,5,0,6 <br> 13) 4,3,1,5,2,0,6,7 <br> 14) 3,5,0,1,4,7,2,6 <br> 15) 4,2,1,0,6,7,5,3 <br> 16) 0,2,3,7,1,4,6,5 <br> 17) 7,1,2,4,0,6,5,3 <br> 18) 5,1,7,3,2,4,0,6 <br> 19) 7,6,4,5,0,2,3,1 <br> 20) 2,6,1,4,5,7,0,3 <br> 21) 4,0,6,1,3,7,5,2 <br> 22) 5,6,0,7,3,2,1,4 <br> 23) 6,5,1,3,0,4,7,2 <br> 24) 4,1,7,2,5,6,3,0 <br> 25) 5,2,0,6,7,4,1,3 <br> 26) 3,0,5,6,7,2,4,1 <br> 27) 3,2,5,4,7,0,6,1 <br> 28) 0,6,7,5,1,2,3,4 <br> 29) 4,3,1,0,6,5,2,7 <br> 30) 5,4,6,7,1,0,2,3 <br> 31) 0,4,7,2,3,1,5,6 <br> 32) 2,0,1,5,6,7,4,3 <p>The first round (attempts 0-7) used a constant fixed pattern [2,4,6,1,3,5,7,0] for the Code Array and [7,1,5,4,6,0,3,2] for the test Array for all participants.
20197	Number of word pairs correctly associated	This is the number of word pairs correctly associated out of ten attempts.
20198	Test array presented	This field indicates the layout of symbols presented as a test. <p> The tests were described by an outer array of 33 symbol-digit arrays each containing the digits 0-7. To present some element of unpredictability between participants, each run of the program chose a random starting point in the outer array and presented tests from that point onwards (looping back to the origin if required). The outer array was zero-indexed, so that a value of 0 in this field means that the first symbol-digit array was used for the Coding array. <p> To illustrate, suppose a participant was allocated the value 5 for their start array. Then round 1 would use Array 5 [values 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7] for the Code and Array 6 [6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1] for the Test. Round 2 would still use Array 5 for the Code but Array 7 [1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3] for the test etc. <p>The test arrays are listed below, and also in ~C500~ with the symbol dictionary shown in ~R111~. <p> 0) 5,0,3,6,1,2,4,7 <br> 1) 1,3,5,7,4,6,0,2 <br> 2) 4,5,6,7,3,0,2,1 <br> 3) 1,4,6,7,2,3,0,5 <br> 4) 4,5,1,3,7,2,6,0 <br> 5) 3,5,2,0,4,6,1,7 <br> 6) 6,3,7,2,4,5,0,1 <br> 7) 1,4,5,6,0,7,2,3 <br> 8) 3,4,2,5,6,0,7,1 <br> 9) 2,5,3,0,7,1,6,4 <br> 10) 3,6,4,1,0,5,7,2 <br> 11) 5,3,2,0,4,1,7,6 <br> 12) 2,3,4,1,7,5,0,6 <br> 13) 4,3,1,5,2,0,6,7 <br> 14) 3,5,0,1,4,7,2,6 <br> 15) 4,2,1,0,6,7,5,3 <br> 16) 0,2,3,7,1,4,6,5 <br> 17) 7,1,2,4,0,6,5,3 <br> 18) 5,1,7,3,2,4,0,6 <br> 19) 7,6,4,5,0,2,3,1 <br> 20) 2,6,1,4,5,7,0,3 <br> 21) 4,0,6,1,3,7,5,2 <br> 22) 5,6,0,7,3,2,1,4 <br> 23) 6,5,1,3,0,4,7,2 <br> 24) 4,1,7,2,5,6,3,0 <br> 25) 5,2,0,6,7,4,1,3 <br> 26) 3,0,5,6,7,2,4,1 <br> 27) 3,2,5,4,7,0,6,1 <br> 28) 0,6,7,5,1,2,3,4 <br> 29) 4,3,1,0,6,5,2,7 <br> 30) 5,4,6,7,1,0,2,3 <br> 31) 0,4,7,2,3,1,5,6 <br> 32) 2,0,1,5,6,7,4,3 <p>The first round (attempts 0-7) used a constant fixed pattern [2,4,6,1,3,5,7,0] for the Code Array and [7,1,5,4,6,0,3,2] for the test Array for all participants.
20199	Antibiotic codes for last 3 months	Antibiotic code
20200	Values wanted	This is the value matching the displayed symbol according to the coding dictionary presented on the screen. <p> To illustrate, the initial training screen displays <ul> <li>[2,4,6,1,3,5,7,0] - code (upper) Array</li> <li>[7,1,5,4,6,0,3,2] - test (lower) Array </li> </ul> Then the leftmost picture in the test Array has index 7 (a crescent). In the upper code array the crescent appears above the numeral 7, so the value wanted here is 7. <p> The next item in the test Array has index 1 (an "H" shape), which appears above the numeral 4 in the code array. <p> The last item in the test Array has an index 2 (an "="), which appears above the numeral 1 in the code array.

20204	Liver Imaging - T1 ShMoLLI - DICOM	Experimental sequence developed by Oxford OCMR group. A single breath-hold cardiac-gated T1-mapping Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery sequence (typically 12 seconds), which acquires a series of seven images (8mm slice thickness, in-plane pixel spacing 9.3mm) each with a different T1 weighting.
20205	ECG datasets	ECG datasets are stored as XML formatted records containing the lead-traces and some ancillary reporting data.
20206	Measurements of pancreas volume - DICOM	Different method of measuring fat around pancreas (one will likely be dropped eventually).
20207	Scout images for heart MRI - DICOM	Scout images for heart scans
20208	Long axis heart images - DICOM	Long Axis measures in three directions to cover various chambers of the heart.
20209	Short axis heart images - DICOM	Short axis scans. Used to measure function of heart.<p>Note that the number will vary depending on the size of the participant since the larger the heart the more slices are required. There should always be a relationship between the number of images in the _inlineVF series and the number of SAX series. Roughly invlineVF = SAX_b1 + b2 + bn + LAX_2ch _ LAX_3ch + LAX_4ch.
20210	Aortic distensibilty images - DICOM	Aortic distensibilty scans.
20211	Cine tagging images - DICOM	Cine tagging
20212	Left ventricular outflow tract images - DICOM	Left Ventricular Outflow Tract scan.
20213	Blood flow images - DICOM	Measures blood flow to try and identify heart disease.
20214	Experimental shMOLLI sequence images - DICOM	Experimental shMOLLI sequence used by Oxford OCMR.
20215	Scout images for brain scans - DICOM	Scout images for brain scans
20216	T1 structural brain images - DICOM	The DICOM image was acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 1x1x1 mm <br> Field-of-view: 208x256x256 matrix <br> Scan duration: 5 minutes <br>3D MPRAGE, sagittal, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, prescan-normalise
20217	Functional brain images - task - DICOM	The DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 2.4x2.4x2.4 mm <br>Field-of-view: 88x88x64 matrix <br>Duration: 4 minutes (332 timepoints) <br>TR: 0.735 s <br>TE: 39ms <br>GE-EPI with x8 multislice acceleration, no iPAT, flip angle 52 degrees, fat saturation <p> As implemented in the CMRR multiband acquisition, a separate "single-band reference scan" is also acquired. This has the same geometry (including EPI distortion) as the timeseries data, but has higher between-tissue contrast to noise, and is used as the reference scan in head motion correction and alignment to other modalities.
20218	Multiband diffusion brain images - DICOM	The DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 2x2x2 mm <br>Field-of-view: 104x104x72 matrix <br>Duration: 7 minutes (including 36 seconds phase-encoding reversed data) <br>10x b=0, 50x b=1000, 50x b=2000 <br>SE-EPI with x3 multislice acceleration, no iPAT, fat saturation <p> For the two diffusion-weighted shells, 50 distinct diffusion-encoding directions were acquired (and all 100 directions are distinct). The diffusion prepraration is a standard ("monopolar") Stejskal-Tanner pulse sequence. This enables higher SNR due to a shorter echo time (TE=92ms) than than a twice-refocused ("bipolar") sequence. This improvement comes at the expense of stronger eddy current distortions, which are removed in the processed data available in NIFTI format.
20219	Susceptibility weighted brain images - DICOM	The DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 0.8x0.8x3 mm <br> Field-of-view: 256x288x48 matrix <br>Duration: 2.5 minutes <br>Two echos, TE=9.42,20 ms <br>2D, axial, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, partial Fourier = 7/8, prescan-normalise <p> To date (Oct 2015) the magnitude and phase images have been saved for each RF coil and echo time separately. In future the expectation is to combine these on the scanner
20220	T2 FLAIR structural brain images - DICOM	The DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 1.05x1x1 mm <br>Field-of-view: 192x256x256 matrix <br>Duration: 6 minutes <br>3D SPACE, sagittal, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, partial Fourier = 7/8, fat saturation, elliptical k-space scanning, prescannormalise
20221	T2/PD brain images - DICOM	The T2/PD scan was originally tentatively included as a standard protocol in diagnostic imaging for the detection of some pathologies. Consultation with research experts concluded it has little or no value to the research questions UK Biobank is likely to investigate. Further, the b=0 dMRI scans can to some extent be used as a surrogate for this. Hence in the face of overall scan time pressure, the T2/PD scan was dropped from the protocol during the pilot.

20250	Multiband diffusion brain images - NIFTI	Multiband diffusion brain images in NIFTI format. <p> The source DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 2x2x2 mm <br>Field-of-view: 104x104x72 matrix <br>Duration: 7 minutes (including 36 seconds phase-encoding reversed data) <br>10x b=0, 50x b=1000, 50x b=2000 <br>SE-EPI with x3 multislice acceleration, no iPAT, fat saturation <p> For the two diffusion-weighted shells, 50 distinct diffusion-encoding directions were acquired (and all 100 directions are distinct). The diffusion prepraration is a standard ("monopolar") Stejskal-Tanner pulse sequence. This enables higher SNR due to a shorter echo time (TE=92ms) than than a twice-refocused ("bipolar") sequence. This improvement comes at the expense of stronger eddy current distortions, which are removed in the image processing pipeline. <p> The average size of these NIFTI datasets is 550MB per participant.
20251	Susceptibility weighted brain images - NIFTI	Susceptibility weighted brain images in NIFTI format. <p> The source DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 0.8x0.8x3 mm <br> Field-of-view: 256x288x48 matrix <br>Duration: 2.5 minutes <br>Two echos, TE=9.42,20 ms <br>2D, axial, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, partial Fourier = 7/8, prescan-normalise <p> To date (Oct 2015) the magnitude and phase images have been saved for each RF coil and echo time separately. In future the expectation is to combine these on the scanner. <p> The average size of these NIFTI datasets is 35MB per participant.
20252	T1 structural brain images - NIFTI	T1 structural images in NIFTI format. <p> The source DICOM image was acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 1x1x1 mm <br> Field-of-view: 208x256x256 matrix <br> Scan duration: 5 minutes <br>3D MPRAGE, sagittal, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, prescan-normalise <p> The average size of these NIFTI datasets is 50MB per participant.
20253	T2 FLAIR structural brain images - NIFTI	T2 FLAIR structural brain images in NIFTI format. <p> The source DICOM images were acquired using the following parameters: <p> Resolution: 1.05x1x1 mm <br>Field-of-view: 192x256x256 matrix <br>Duration: 6 minutes <br>3D SPACE, sagittal, in-plane acceleration iPAT=2, partial Fourier = 7/8, fat saturation, elliptical k-space scanning, prescannormalise <p> The average size of these NIFTI datasets is 30MB per participant.

22700	Date first recorded at location	This the date at which a participant is first recorded (according to the record sources available to UK Biobank) at the location given in ~F22702~ and ~F22704~ (or the more precise, but restricted, ~F22701~ and ~F22703~). <p> Note that, when data is supplied to approved researchers, the array index of dates will not necessarily be in the same order as the dates themselves as UK Biobank does not itself receive location data in chronological order.
22701	Home location - east co-ordinate	This location information is based on the postcode for an address at which the participant is believed to have been resident, derived from a number of sources. <p> The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference. This East co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the North co-ordinate in ~F22703~. <p> These grid co-ordinates (to a 100m accuracy) will only be released following special approval. For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. These rounded values are found in ~F22702~ and ~F22704~.
22702	Home location - east co-ordinate (rounded)	This location information is based on the postcode for an address at which the participant is believed to have been resident, derived from a number of sources. <p> The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference, rounded to the nearest Kilometre. This East co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the North co-ordinate in ~F22704~. <p> For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. Research proposals that require location details to a finer level of granularity (i.e. 100m) should request ~F22701~ and ~F22703~, however special approval will be required to release the more detailed information. <p> In some cases participants will appear to be at the same location at consecutive times. This occurs because there is a difference of under 1Km in the distance between two consecutive locations according to the more granular data.
22703	Home location - north co-ordinate	This location information is based on the postcode for an address at which the participant is believed to have been resident, derived from a number of sources. <p> The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference. This North co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the East co-ordinate in ~F22701~. <p> These grid co-ordinates (to a 100m accuracy) will only be released following special approval. For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. These rounded values are found in ~F22702~ and ~F22704~.
22704	Home location - north co-ordinate (rounded)	This location information is based on the postcode for an address at which the participant is believed to have been resident, derived from a number of sources. <p> The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference, rounded to the nearest Kilometre.

26410	Index of Multiple Deprivation (England)	The English Indices of Deprivation 2010 are measures of multiple deprivation at the small area level. The model of multiple deprivation which underpins the Indices of Deprivation 2010 is based on the idea of distinct domains of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These domains are experienced by individuals living in an area. People may be counted in one or more of the domains, depending on the number of types of deprivation that they experience.<p> Each domain represents a specific form of deprivation experienced by people and each can be measured individually using a number of indicators. Seven distinct domains have been identified in the English Indices of Deprivation; Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and Services, Living Environment Deprivation, and Crime. Individual domains can be used in isolation as measures of each specific form of deprivation. They can also be combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there. Along with two supplementary indices, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index, they form the English Indices of Deprivation. These statistics allow the most, and least, deprived areas of the country to be identified as well as providing information about the issues faced by people living in different parts of the country.
26411	Income score (England)	This domain measures the proportion of the population in an area experiencing deprivation related to low income. A combined count of income deprived individuals per LSOA is calculated by summing the following five indicators: <ul> <li>Adults and children in Income Support families</li> <li>Adults and children in Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance families</li> <li>Adults and children in Pension Credit (Guarantee) families</li> <li>Adults and children in Child Tax Credit families (who are not in receipt of Income Support, Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance or Pension Credit) whose equivalised income (excluding housing benefits) is below 60 per cent of the median before housing costs</li> <li>Asylum seekers in England in receipt of subsistence support, accommodation support, or both.</li> </ul>
26412	Employment score (England)	This domain measures employment deprivation in an area conceptualised as involuntary exclusion of the working age population from the labour market. A combined count of employment deprived individuals per LSOA is calculated by summing the following seven indicators: <ul> <li>Claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance (both Contributory and Income-Based) women aged 18-59 and men aged 18-64, averaged over 4 quarters</li> <li>Claimants of Incapacity Benefit women aged 18-59 and men aged 18-64, averaged over 4 quarters</li> <li>Claimants of Severe Disablement Allowance women aged 18-59 and men aged 18-64, averaged over 4 quarters</li> <li>Claimants of Employment Support Allowance women aged 18-59 and men aged 18-64</li> <li>Participants in New Deal for the 18-24s who are not in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance, averaged over 4 quarters</li> <li>Participants in New Deal for 25+ who are not in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance, averaged over 4 quarters</li> <li>Participants in New Deal for Lone Parents (after initial interview) aged over 18, averaged over 4 quarters.</li> </ul>
26413	Health score (England)	This domain measures premature death and the impairment of quality of life by poor health. It considers both physical and mental health. The domain measures morbidity, disability and premature mortality but not aspects of behaviour or environment that may be predictive of future health deprivation. Four indicators are used to calculate this domain: <ul> <li>Years of Potential Life Lost - an age and sex standardised measure of premature death</li> <li>Comparative Illness and Disability Ratio - an age and sex standardised measure of morbidity and disability</li> <li>Measures of acute morbidity - an age and sex standardised rate of emergency admissions to hospital</li> <li>Proportion of adults under 60 suffering from mood or anxiety disorders - a modelled indicator for the proportion of adults suffering from mood and anxiety disorders.</li> </ul>
26414	Education score (England)	This domain measures the extent of deprivation in terms of education, skills and training in an area. The indicators are structured into two sub-domains: one relating to children and young people and one relating to adult skills. These two sub-domains are designed to reflect the 'flow' and 'stock' of educational disadvantage within an area respectively. Seven indicators are used to calculate this domain: <ul> <li>Average points score of pupils taking English, Maths and Science Key Stage 2 exams</li> <li>Average points score of pupils taking English, Maths and Science Key Stage 3 exams</li> <li>Average capped points score of pupils taking Key Stage 4 (GCSE or equivalent) exams</li> <li>Proportion of young people not staying on in school or non-advanced education above age 16</li> <li>Secondary school absence rate - the proportion of authorised and unauthorised absences from secondary school</li> <li>Proportion of those aged under 21 not entering Higher Education.</li> <li>Proportion of adults aged 25-54 with no or low qualifications.</li> </ul>
26415	Housing score (England)	This domain measures the physical and financial accessibility of housing and key local services. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: 'geographical barriers', which relate to the physical proximity of local services, and 'wider barriers' which includes issues relating to access to housing such as affordability. Seven indicators are combined to calculate this domain: <ul> <li>Household overcrowding - the proportion of households within an LSOA which are judged to have insufficient space to meet the household's needs</li> <li>Homelessness - the rate of acceptances for housing assistance under the homelessness provisions of the 1996 Housing Act (at local authority district level) </li> <li>Difficulty of access to owner-occupation (local authority district level) - proportion of households aged under 35 whose income means they are unable to afford to enter owner occupation</li> <li>Road distance to a GP surgery</li> <li>Road distance to a supermarket or convenience store</li> <li>Road distance to a primary school</li> <li>Road distance to a Post Office.</li> </ul>
26416	Crime score (England)	This domain measures the rate of recorded crime in an area for four major crime types representing the risk of personal and material victimisation at a small area level. <ul> <li>Violence - number of reported violent crimes (19 reported crime types) per 1000 at risk population</li> <li>Burglary - number of reported burglaries (4 reported crime types) per 1000 at risk population</li> <li>Theft - number of reported thefts (5 reported crime types) per 1000 at risk population</li> <li>Criminal damage - number of reported crimes (11 reported crime types) per 1000 at risk population.</li> </ul>
26417	Living environment score (England)	This domain measures the quality of individuals' immediate surroundings both within and outside the home. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: the 'indoors' living environment, which measures the quality of housing, and the 'outdoors' living environment which contains two measures relating to air quality and road traffic accidents. Four indicators are combined to calculate this domain: <ul> <li>Social and private housing in poor condition</li> <li>Houses with central heating</li> <li>Air quality</li> <li>Road traffic accidents.</li> </ul>
26418	Income score (Wales)	The purpose of this domain is to capture the extent of deprivation relating to income at a small area level across Wales. It focuses on the proportion of people living in households with income below a defined threshold or claiming benefits relating to low incomes. The indicators used for the income domain were: <ul> <li>Adults & children in income support households</li> <li>Adults & children in pension credit households</li> <li>Adults & children in income-based job seekers allowance households</li> <li>Adults & children in tax credit (child tax credit and working tax credit) households below a low income threshold</li> <li>National Asylum Support Service (NASS) supported asylum seekers in Wales in receipt of subsistence only and accommodation support</li> </ul>
26419	Employment score (Wales)	The purpose of this domain is to capture the extent of deprivation relating to employment at a small area level across Wales, and focuses on the proportion of working age people claiming out-of-work benefits. The indicators used for the employment domain were: <ul> <li>Claimants of unemployment-related benefits</li> <li>Claimants of incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance</li> <li>Participants on New Deal for Young People and Intensive Activity Period (for New Deal 25+) not included in unemployment-related benefit counts</li> <li>Participants on New Deal for Lone Parents</li> </ul>

26421	Education score (Wales)	The purpose of this domain is to capture the extent of deprivation relating to education, training and skills at a small-area level across Wales. It is designed to reflect the 'stock' and 'flow' or educational disadvantage within an area, by capturing low attainment among children and young people and the lack of qualifications and skills in adults. The indicators used for the education domain were: <ul> <li>Key Stage 2, average point scores</li> <li>Key Stage 3, average point scores</li> <li>Key Stage 4, average point scores</li> <li>Primary school absence rates</li> <li>Secondary school absence rates</li> <li>Proportion of people not entering Higher Education aged 18-19</li> <li>Number of adults aged 25 - 59/64 with no qualifications</li> </ul>
26422	Access to services score (Wales)	The purpose of this domain is to illustrate the deprivation as a result of a household's inability to access a range of services, considered necessary for day-to-day living. The access is by walking or using public bus services or both. The indicators used for the geographical access to services domain were: <ul> <li>Food shop</li> <li>GP surgery</li> <li>Primary school</li> <li>Post office</li> <li>Public library</li> <li>Leisure centre</li> <li>NHS dentist</li> <li>Secondary school</li> <li>Transport nodes</li> </ul>

26424	Physical environment score (Wales)	The purpose of this domain is to measure environmental factors that may impact on quality of life in an area. Negative impacts on quality of life are judged to be a form of deprivation. Environmental deprivation is generally not correlated with social or economic deprivation in Wales. (ref: Walker et al 2003). This domain does not capture aspects of deprivation such as health inequalities (this is an objective of the Health domain). Data covering Wales is not available on actual impacts on quality of life; so factors were chosen that were judged to indicate an increased potential for reduced quality of life and had data available. The indicators used for the physical environment domain were: <ul> <li>Air Quality</li> <li>Air Emissions</li> <li>Flood risk</li> <li>Proximity to waste disposal and industrial sites</li> </ul>
26425	Community safety score (Wales)	The purpose of this domain is to reflect where people are deprived of a safe community in which to live. Safety includes levels of household and personal crime and quality of experience in public places compatible with access to ordinary work, leisure and social relationships. The indicators used for the Community Safety domain were: <ul> <li>Police Force Recorded Crime</li> <li>Youth Offenders</li> <li>Adult Offenders</li> <li>Fire Incidence</li> </ul>
26426	Index of Multiple Deprivation (Wales)	The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2008 is the official measure of deprivation for small areas in Wales. It was developed for the Welsh Assembly Government by the Assembly's Statistical Directorate and the Local Government Data Unit (Wales). <p> The WIMD 2008 is made up of eight separate domains (or kinds) of deprivation: income, employment, health, education, housing, environment, access to services, and community safety. <p> Each of them was based on a range of different indicators which meant that they were measured in different ways using different units. So before they could be combined the measurements had to be transformed to make them compatible. For example, if the height of something had been measured in metres and the weight in kilograms it would not make sense simply to add them together. <p> Income and employment were classed as the most important factors, and they were given the biggest weighting in the overall index. Although there is more to deprivation than poverty, not having enough money or a job is a big part of it.
26427	Index of Multiple Deprivation (Scotland)	The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2009 identifies small area concentrations of multiple deprivation across Scotland in a consistent manner. The SIMD combines data from seven distinct domains or topic areas all of which are considered to be important contributors to deprivation levels. These domains have remained the same as in the previous version of the index, published in 2006, and the data used in compiling each one is the most appropriate and up to date that was available at the time of constructing the index. <p> The SIMD is a relative measure of deprivation that uses 6,505 data zones across Scotland as its unit of comparison. The rank applied to each of these data zones identifies each as being more or less deprived than all the others in the country. The rankings run from 1 being the most deprived to 6505 being the least deprived. Therefore the smaller the ranking the more deprived the data zone. As the SIMD is a relative measure it cannot show how much more deprived one data zone is than another, e.g. that a data zone ranked 5 is twice as deprived as a data zone ranked 10. In the same way the distance between each ranking can vary - so the gap between the data zones ranked 16 and 17 could be very small while the gap between those ranked 17 and 18 could be much bigger. <p> The SIMD can be used to identify the small areas with the highest concentrations of multiple deprivation in Scotland using either the overall index or the individual domains. The most commonly used cut off levels are 10%, 15% or 20% - although different cut offs may be required depending on individual policy or organisational focus.

90002	Data problem indicator	The data problem indicator was derived by combining participant reports (e.g. non-wear) with measurements of the size of the uncompressed dataset returned by the accelerometer device. This field is only present for accelerometer datasets that have had a problem recorded against them. A value of zero indicates that a dataset reported as unreliable was subsequently examined and found to be acceptable.
90003	Start of requested wear period	When devices were dispatched to participants they were programmed to start recording (usually at 10.00am) on a particular date, targeted to be the day they arrived at the participants address. The participant was asked to begin wearing the device immediately upon receipt. This field gives the date and time that the recording was programmed to start - which may be before or after the participant actually began wearing the device, and does not guarantee that the participant actually wore it.

90012	Overall acceleration average	This is the recommended variable for physical activity analysis. <p> For final analysis of this variable, it is recommend researchers filter out participants whose data could not be calibrated (~F90016~) or who did not wear the device for sufficiently long to get a stable measure of their physical activity status (~F90015~). For a detailed description, please refer to ~R169649~.

90015	Data quality, good wear time	At least three days (72 hours) of data and also having data in each one-hour period of the 24-hour cycle (scattered over multiple days)
90016	Data quality, good calibration	YES indicates that the raw accelerometer data has been well calibrated. <p> NO indicates that a participant should be excluded from further analysis because recalibration by the preceding or subsequent measurement was not possible due to insufficient data.
90017	Data quality, calibrated on own data	YES indicates sufficient data were available to conduct calibration on the participant's own stationary data (where any of the three sensor axes did not have values outside a +/- 300 milli-gravity range). <p> NO indicates that the data was recalibrated using the previous (or if unavailable, the next) accelerometer record from the same device worn by a different participant.
