Old code for a side analysis that was never completed.

fe_crams/ - used to contain ~30K CRAM files from the FE WES pipeline. Files have since been deleted
to save space. CRAM files can now only be accessed through the UKB research access pipeline
and so any new analysis of this data needs to be done there.
fe_cram_str_calls/ - STR calls on ~30K CRAMs from WES from the FE pipeline.
bed_files/ - descriptions of the regions of the genome that were used in the WES and/or had alt-contigs

Notes:
From the supplemental methods listed here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/572347v1.supplementary-material
it seems that coverage was required to be at least 20x for 85% of target bp, which means
that the minimum average total coverage would be 17x
