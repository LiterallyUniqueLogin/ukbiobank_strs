Subsetting to samples with phenotype that passed sample_qc, as denoted by the file: /expanse/projects/gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/sample_qc/runs/alkaline_phosphatase/combined_unrelated.sample
Standardizing covariates (subtracting mean, then dividing by standard deviation)
Ranking phenotype. Tie breaks for equal ranks are arbitrary and stable.
Inverse normalizing phenotype ranks to the standard normal distribution via the transformation rank -> normal_quantile((rank + 0.5)/nsamples).
