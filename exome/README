ukb...enc - the enc file from the UKB application which contains the permissions
   to download the exome data.
   See https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/exinfo.cgi?src=AccessingData for details.
k...key - the key used to authenticate the enc file
fetch_bulk_gvcfs.py - python script using dask to invoke the ukb downloader one 
   file at a time
launch_fetch_bulk_spb_gvcfs.pbs - batch script to launch a job for the python dask script
   for downloading all the spb vcf files
launch_fetch_10_bulk_fe_gvcfs.pbs - batch script to launch a job for the python dask script
   for downloading 10 fe vcf files
confirm_spb_exome_download.pbs - make sure none of the downloads are truncated
bed_files/ - descriptions of the regions of the genome that were used in the WES and/or had alt-contigs

spb_gvcfs.bulk - one line for each file to download
fe_gcvfs.10.bulk - same as spb_gvcfs.bulk, but for the fe pipeline and only 10 ppts

spb_vcfs/ contains:
* the spb exome files (data fields 23176 and 23177) for 
  the first ~50k participants.
  These are named $ID.tbi and $ID.vcf.gz for each numeric ID
  Each VCF includes all chromosomes
* Byproducts f${ID}_23176_0_0.lis and f${ID}_23177_0_0.lis
  for each of those downloads
* output/ - output files for pbs and dask jobs

fe_vcfs contains the same as spb_vcfs except:
* the fields are 23161 and 23162 respectively
* only 10ppts of data

fe_plink contains the plink representation of the calls in the fe pipelines in the usual
.bed, .bim and .fam file. The .bed file contains all the calls for all the samples across all chromosomes.

Notes:
From the supplemental methods listed here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/572347v1.supplementary-material
it seems that coverage was required to be at least 20x for 85% of target bp, which means
that the minimum average total coverage would be 17x
