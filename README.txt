This is the code repository for associaTR - performing associations between short tandem repeat lengths and phenotypes
Documentation for associaTR is coming soon.

This is also the code repository for the analyses and figures described in the paper:
Margoliash et al., Polymorphic short tandem repeats make widespread contributions to blood and serum traits
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.502370v1

README_analysis.txt contains details on the workflow and folders used in the analyses and figures
in that study.

README_dataset.txt contains details on the locations of the UKB data that those analyses were run on.
For those reading this online - most of this data is not present in the git repo and would need
to be accessed from the UKB after applying for access.
