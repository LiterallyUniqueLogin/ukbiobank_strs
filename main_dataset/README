Only needs to be done once:
The instructions for downloading these are described here:

(The accessing data guide here: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/exinfo.cgi?src=AccessingData)
in section 2
Only someone with the email from the original application
(i.e. Jonathan Margoliash in the Gymrek lab) can download the .enc file that is the
encoded file containing all of the data
cd to the directory with the .enc file, and set $UKB_UTILITIES to the 
appropriate directory.
Unpack the enc into a enc_ukb file by running:
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbunpack ukb29170.enc k29170.key
This will generate a ukb29170.enc_ukb file


Extracting individual data fields from .enc_ukb files:
The ukbconv utilities can be used to generate the .csv (or other
data files) from the .enc_ukb file
To do this:
cd to the directory with the .enc_ukb file, and set $UKB_UTILITIES to the 
appropriate directory.
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb docs -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the documentation for the dataset (ukb29170.html)
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb csv -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the csv
If a data field isn't present in one of the enc files, try retrieving it from
the other. They contain different fields from different requests we made.

$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb bulk -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
creates the bulk data file that's used to download
bulk data sets (such as the exome data BAM files) - though
at this point you should probably be working on DNA Nexus

The ukb29170.log and fields.ukb are generated as side effects of the above
commands

You can retrieve subsets of the data or output the data in different
formats using different options with ukbconv, see the linked PDF above
