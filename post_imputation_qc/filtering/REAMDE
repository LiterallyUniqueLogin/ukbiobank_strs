Using vcf with cparse is 1.5 - 2x slower than without,
probably because all the python unicode strings need to be convered to binary strings
Lazy parsing of samples improves speed by about 2x. Still way to slow
On top of lazy parsing, not pre-splitting all the samples saves 0-.5 seconds per line.
Still nowhere close enough
