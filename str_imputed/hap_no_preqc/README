Order to run/understand files in this directory:

Step 1:
impute.pbs creates vcfs with the imputed STRs.
It calls cut_input_vcf.sh and run_beagle.sh
These produce the output 
* vcf_batches/chrX_samples_YYYY_to_ZZZZ.vcf.gz
* vcf_batches/chrX_samples_YYYY_to_ZZZZ.vcf.gz.tbi
* vcf_batches/chrX_samples_YYYY_to_ZZZZ.log 
launch_impute.py launches many batches of impute.pbs for an entire chromosome
if this is being run for the second time, it will only run for batches that produced no output
or had errors in them
It will move log and job output files for jobs that are being rerun into vcf_batches/old/
It puts the job output files in vcf_batches/output/
It moves the log files for all jobs that were previously completed successfully and aren't
being rerun from vcf_batches/ into vcf_batches/output/
This makes ~500 VCFs containing the entire chr but a subset of samples

check_for_errors is a utility which can be called after this point which will print out all the 
errors from all the batch jobs run

Step 3:
mergeWithinChrRegions.pbs
it puts the vcfs into vcf_batches/chrX_pos_YYYY_to_ZZZZZ.vcf.gz
and vcf_batches/chrX_pos_YYYY_to_ZZZZZ.vcf.gz.tbi
job output goes into mergeWithinChrRegionsOutput/
launchMergeWithinChrRegions.py launches this for each region
It makes ~20 regional VCFs containing all samples

Step 4:
concatChrRegions.pbs concats all the chromosome regions produced by the merge into one .vcf.gz file
it produces the final vcf file in vcfs/chrX.vcf and vcfs/chrX.vcf.gz.tbi
it puts the job output in concatChrRegionsOutput/
it can be run with qsub -v "INPUT1=X" concatChrRegions.pbs where X is the chromosome number
