These phenotypes are called the "main dataset" by the UKB documentation
The instructions for downloading these are described here:
https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~bbdatan/Accessing_UKB_data_v2.0.pdf
in section 2
Only someone with the email from the original application
(i.e. Richard) can download this data
The dataset is the .enc file
The ukbunpack and ukbconv utilities can be used to generate the .csv (or other)
datafiles from this file

To do this:
put the .ukbkey, the ukbunpack, ukbconv and the .enc files in the same directory
./ukbunpack ukb29170.enc .ukbkey
This will generate a ukb29170.enc_ukb file
./ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb docs
generates the documentation for the dataset (ukb29170.html)
./ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb csv
generates the csv
./ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb bulk
creates the bulk data file that's used to download
bulk data sets (such as the exome data BAM files)

The ukb29170.log and fields.ukb are generated as side effects of the above
commands

The csv file contains all the data

The fields file just lists the numerical name of all the columns
in the csv file. Each of these is just the data-field id (or sub-ID)
of a piece of data that can be looked up in the UKB showcase

(
-- The following is valid but no longer useful, use the docs file generated above --
The field.text file provides descriptions of the meanings of all the field-ids
To download:
wget -nd -O field.txt "biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/scdown.cgi?fmt=txt&id=1"
