The exome_filtered analysis was done using a slightly different set of STRs
than I now count as exome STRs. But I've concluded that it is a set
of 627 STRs, whileas my current exome STR set is 630 STRs, and 626 out 
of the 627 are included in the current set, so the analysis is still
almost exactly correct.

Testing this:
cd exome_filtered
mkdir temp
for chr in $(seq 1 22); do sed -e 's/^/chr/' chr"$chr".tab > temp/chr"$chr".tab ; done
for chr in $(seq 1 22); do sed -i -e 's/chrchrom/chrom/' temp/chr"$chr".tab ; done

# confirm each STR maps to an ID in the SNPSTR reference panel
# specifically, the patter '\t\.' is not present in the file
for chr in $(seq 1 22); do
	bedtools intersect -loj -wa -wb -a temp/chr"$chr".tab -b /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/side_analyses/exome_strs/intermediate_files/snpstr_strs_19.bed
done | vim -

# compare the mapped IDs to the SNPSTR IDs that I have deemed as exome STRs

	<(for chr in $(seq 1 22) ; do bedtools intersect -loj -wa -wb -a temp/chr"$chr".tab -b /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/side_analyses/exome_strs/intermediate_files/snpstr_strs_19.bed ; done | awk '{print $10}' | sort) \
