Check difference in first pass susie alpha v pip - PIPs have changed for some reason (but files are identical otherwise). Fix.
Check difference in followup pass graphs - different definition of regions. Still worth debugging, or do I assume this is working?
add susie mpv graphs?
How do we document changes to the figs and supplementary tables that won't be tracked with track changes?
Fig 3 and supp fig 13 Change discovery p-value to -log10(discovery p-value)
generate finemapped results table with support 2+ gene annotations instead of all gene annotations? Or if not, then need to say in methods.
Need to follow up on supp table 6

Regenerate supp fig 4 with only alphas from pure CSes

fine-mapping mac uses MACs that I believe were calculated across the entire sample set, not just the current ethnicity/population
Fix this?

Images that still need to be WDL for new fine-mapping : 1c, supp figs 2
RHOT1 conditional manhattan?
CBL mean sphered cell volume association to conditional manhattan?
SLC2A2 association and manhattan?

Swap all association images for WGS images and change captions accordingly

CBL Shai's suggestion:
In megakaryocytes, CBL encodes c-CBL a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling43 by targeting the TPO receptor and additional downstream components of the signaling pathway to proteasomal degradation [PMID 19880496].  Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary regulator of megakaryocyte progenitor expansion and differentiation [PMID: 8578518] **I use a different citation by the same author here**. CBL mutations are rarely implicated in myeloproliferative disorders including essential thrombocythemia [PMID: 26182311 PMID: 24325359]. **I didn't think this was compelling and so removed this sentence** In mice, tissue specific loss of c-CBL function in megakaryocytes was associated with increased platelet count [PMID: 32954656].

Impact factor of journal - less than 2 or 3 might worry about citing
References - done checking all!:

p1 par3 - no reference for noncanonical RNA secondary structures - need one or remove claim.
R-loop/G-loop quadraplex RNA secondary structure
Ask Xuan

p2 par1 -  reference 19 to 1000 genomes doesn't include STRs, but that's not directly because they're not part of microarray,
rather they tried and found lobstr insufficient.

Need to reword p2 par 1

* Is it reasonable to assume that INDEL calling doesn't sufficiently represent STRs? If so, shoudl include UK10K reference panel
as a citation: https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9111#MOESM1094 - don'mt specifically incldue STRs is probably okay

* I assert that STRs are often ignored even in GWAS from WGS data sets - need to back this up with citation

Change citation 35 (apo B is backbone of LDL C) - this shows it is backbone of VLDL particles, and in a way that's buried. Find
a better reference.

The following statement needs a citation:
BCL2L11 in particular is pro-apoptotic and is required in the tightly regulated lifespan of myeloid lineage cells




---------------------------------------------

Things to remember (not change):

Fine-mapping was done with duplicated versions of these STRs:
^17\t80520458|^1\t247747217|^1\t247848392|^21\t47741815|^8\t145231731

uncovered 16287713 for mean corpuscular haemoglobin that has a low p-value and no fine-mapping from very old code and a high p-value and successful fine-mapping from new code. Worth double checking or nah?
