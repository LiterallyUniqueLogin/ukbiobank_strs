The INFO fields that should have been published with the STRs in the SNP STR reference panel.
These were lost during Beagle imputation and not readded.

View to remove samples (which I should not have access to), then annotate to remove fields that summarize
sample data (which again, I should not have access to)

for chr in $(seq 1 22); do
