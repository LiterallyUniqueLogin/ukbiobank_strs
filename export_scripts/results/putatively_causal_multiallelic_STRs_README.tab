Any STR x phenotype association that has p-value <= 1e-10 and FINEMAP posterior probability of causality >= 0.8 and multiallelicness >= 0.025
chrom
start_pos - the start bp of the STR, 1-based
repeat_unit - as preliminarily inferred by TRTools from the reference STR sequence and the repeat period stated in the SNPSTR reference panel
multiallelicness - amongst the population being tested for association, this is the fraction of total allelic dosage at this locus taken up by all alleles but the two most common alleles
association_p_value
pcausal - FINEMAP's posterior probability of causality
relation_to_gene - if this STR is transcribed, for each transcript what is the GENCODE gene type of that transcript (i.e. protein coding, lncRNA, etc.) and what is the GENCODE feature type of the region the STR is in (i.e. intron, exon, etc.)
transcribed - whether or not this STR is transcribed in any gene or untranslated RNA
