Times (seconds/SNP variant line, reading from start of Chr21) (seconds/variants line, 21:15449726-15454050, contains a 3-variant STR, a 34 variant STR and a bunch of SNPs)
cyvcf2 0.13 0.24
bgzf reader, 1 byte at a time ~3.5
bgzf reader, 1 line at a time, not looking at it 0.011
bgzf reader, 1 line a a time looking at each byte 0.21
gzip reader, 1 line a a time looking at each byte 0.23 (same as above, makes sense, these should be the same)
pyvcf with my lazy evaluation speed up ~2.2
pyvcf with cparse and my lazy evaluation speed up ~2.15



Aside:
Using vcf with cparse is not faster 
probably because all the python unicode strings need to be convered to binary strings
