original HDL finemapping FINEMAP regions 1_219976499_220226499 and 20_55711040_55961040 seem to have the wrong p_val threshold (using variants with p_val >= 0.05). Others for HDL?
Check difference in first pass susie alpha v pip - PIPs have changed for some reason (but files are identical otherwise). Fix.
Check difference in followup pass graphs - different definition of regions. Still worth debugging, or do I assume this is working?
add susie mpv graphs?
How do we document changes to the figs and supplementary tables that won't be tracked with track changes?
Fig 3 and supp fig 13 Change discovery p-value to -log10(discovery p-value)
generate finemapped results table with support 2+ gene annotations instead of all gene annotations? Or if not, then need to say in methods.
Need to follow up on supp table 6

Images that still need to be WDL for new fine-mapping : 1c, supp figs 2
RHOT1 manhattan?
SLC2A2 association and manhattan?
