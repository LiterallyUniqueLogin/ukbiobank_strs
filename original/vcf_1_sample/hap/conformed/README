conform-gt successfully switches the reference vs alternate allele of everything in the reference sample
(despite marking them SAME_STRAND) except for all G/C and A/T alleles, which it FAILS
and marks as UKNOWN_STRAND. No other REMOVED or FAILED alleles are recorded in the chrs I've looked at.

It seems that all the alleles in the UKB are by default defined to be on the plus strand.
And all the alleles in 1000 Genomes are on the plus strand too (ref: https://www.internationalgenome.org/faq/what-strand-are-variants-your-vcf-file/)
So that should give me the info needed to align those alleles.
