All the tools used to download UKB data.
Their use is described here: http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/~bbdatan/Accessing_UKB_data_v2.0.pdf

Before running any ukb tool on tscc, must put the updated version of glibc on the path:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SOURCE/glibc/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(SOURCE=/projects/ps-gymreklab/resources/source)

For whatever reason, trying to run ukbgene of tscc is giving me segfaults
Running it on snorlax works however
The other utilities seem to work on tscc
