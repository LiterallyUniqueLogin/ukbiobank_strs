This directory contains the 650k phased snp genotypes gathered by
microarray chips, in bgen format.
Note that this phased dataset doesn't contain all the 900k microarray genotypes 
that passed the general QC.
Rather, it was selected to meet the following higher QC standard:
"For the pre-phasing step, we only used markers present on both the UK BiLEVE 
and UK Biobank Axiom arrays. We removed markers that failed quality control in 
more than one batch, had a greater than 5% overall missing rate, and had a MAF 
of less than 0.0001. We removed samples that were identified as outliers for 
heterozygosity and missing rate."

The sample file contains a list of all the sample names in a standard format.
Though the sample and fam files say chr1, they are applicable for all chromosomes

This website contains the checksums of the files

I've copied the relevant portion into checksums.txt

The utility ukbmd5 can be used to confirm that the checksums
match (and so that the files have not been corrupted)
