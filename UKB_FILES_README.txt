The contents of this directory (each directory has its own README):
ukb_utilities - the utilities used to download all the data from the data showcase
main_dataset - contains the phenotypes we have access to through UKB
	Doesn't consist of bulk data (microarray data, exomes, imaging, etc.)
microarray - the 650k snp genotypes gathered by microarray chips
array_imputed - the 90m genotypes imputed from the microarray chips
exome - the UKB whole exome sequencing data. NOTE: this has been recalled
   and is only expected to be rereleased Spring 2020
misc_data - miscellaneous small pieces of data associated with the larger datasets
	in the above folders, but located and downloaded separately
