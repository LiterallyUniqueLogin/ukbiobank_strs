UKBiobank data that is stored in EGA instead of in UKB's own webservers
In particular, I needed the sample qc (sqc) file to figure out which samples
were in the white british ancestry subset as defined by the UKB paper

How I got this data:
conda create -n ega
conda activate ega
conda config --add channels bioconda
ega install pyega3
wget https://ega-archive.org/files/CREDENTIALS_FILE
#modify the credentials file: remove the password line, change the email line
pyega3 -cf CREDENTIALS_FILE  datasets
pyega3 -cf CREDENTIALS_FILE files EGAD00010001497 > filesList.txt
#find the file I want
pyega3 -cf CREDENTIALS_FILE fetch EGAF00001844707
conda deactivate

The columns for ukb_sqc_v2.txt are described here: https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=531
The rows unfortunately don't have IDs in them
However, the link indicates they equate to the equivalent row in the fam file
($UKB/microarray/ukb46122_cal_chr1_v2_s488282.fam)
I've confirmed that is the case by checking that
(a) the two files have the same number of rows and
(b) thye sexes match in every (non-redacted) column (confirmed via this script:)

sqc_floc = f'{ukb}/misc_data/EGA/ukb_sqc_v2.txt'
fam_file = np.loadtxt(
        f'{ukb}/microarray/ukb46122_cal_chr1_v2_s488282.fam',
        usecols=(0, 4)
)
not_redacted = np.greater_equal(fam_file[:, 0], 0)
fam_file = fam_file[not_redacted, 1]
sqc_sex = np.loadtxt(sqc_floc, usecols=10, dtype=np.bytes_)
sqc_sex[sqc_sex == b'M'] = 1
sqc_sex[sqc_sex == b'F'] = 3
sqc_sex = sqc_sex.astype(int)
sqc_sex = sqc_sex[not_redacted]
print(np.all(np.equal(sqc_sex, fam_file))) # should be true
