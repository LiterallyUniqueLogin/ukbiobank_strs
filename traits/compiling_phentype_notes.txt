### Cancer Register
https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=40006
Last updated: 2019/03 (retrieved 2021/04/06)
Note that cancer is covered here and not in the first occurrences summary below
which covers most other health related issues.

103k instances of cancer over 85k participants

Breaks down into 156 separate fields, plenty of which
will have enough cases to independently test

Each field also breaks down into subfields, most of those will
not have enough cases to test

### Death summary
https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=40001
Last updated: 2021/01 (retrieved 2021/04/06)

This single data field will have 1,200 ICD10 codes that can
be each tested independently, although almost all codes will have too few participants
to pass quality controls

See below (first occurrences summary) for a list of codes

Also:
40007Age at death

## Not using

Ignoring health and medical history (https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100036)
- assuming it is summarized in health related outcomes here: https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=1712

Currently ignoring mental health questions at assessment centers https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100060
and follow up https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=136 .
Not sure how to summarize them as compared to the mental health summary here: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=2405 

Ignoring verbal interview https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100071

Ignoring cognitive function for the time being here https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100026
and here https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=116
Ignoring brain MRI because I don't know enough to interpret these fields 
or which of these are good subjects for GWAS and/or have reasonable interpretation to
an audience: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100
(ask dad about both later?)

Currently ignoring but could do diet: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100052 and https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=100090
and https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=1039

Ignoring online follow up about digestive health: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=116

Ignoring online follow up about pain: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=154

Ignoring the physical activity measurement - doesn't seem to be any fields that have been
highlighted as of likely interest to researchers

Feels difficult to decide which fields related to social preferences are worth studying,
similarly which fields related to brainc functioning are worth studying. These are both
very high level, I'm not sure what we could draw from an association there.

## Notes
Finished looking through https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/browse.cgi?id=-2&cd=essential_info
