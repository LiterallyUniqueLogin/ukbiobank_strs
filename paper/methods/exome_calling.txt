Idenitfying Hg38 Exome STRs

Start and end coorindates and repeat periods for STRs in the SNPSTR reference
panel were accessed from data generated during the SNPSTR project that was previously
unreleased and is now available here: TODO. These fields were arranged into a 
BED file meeting HipSTR's specification.
(https://github.com/tfwillems/HipSTR#str-region-bed-file)
liftOver (cite) was used to convert this bed from hg19 to hg38, no STRs were
lost during this conversion. The UKB exome capture region was downloaded from
here: biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/auxdata/xgen_plus_spikein.b38.bed
bedtools intersect with the flag -f 1 was used to intersect the hg38 SNPSTR 
bedfile and the exome capture bed file, producing a bed file of STRs from the 
SNPSTR reference panel which were completely contained in the exome capture region


Exome STR Calling

Individual-level CRAM files and indicies produced by the UKB exome Functionally 
Equivalent pipeline were downloaded from showcase fields 23163 and 23164. Due to
UKB throttling of download speeds only 40k of 50k available CRMAs were downloaded
(selection of samples to download was effectively random). HipSTR (cite) was used
to jointly call CRAM files in batches of 4k individuals at a time, this being
close to the maximum number of open files permitted per process in the computational
environment. Batching of individuals was effectively random. In addition to the 
standard flags, HipSTR was run with the flags --bam-libs CRAM_FILES , --bam-samps CRAM_FIELS ,
--regions BED and --max-reads 10000000 , where CRAM_FILES is a comma separated list
of paths to the CRAM files included in the batch being run and BED was a path to
the hg38 bed of exome STRs produced above.
