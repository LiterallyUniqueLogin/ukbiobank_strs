This directory contains the phenotypes we have access to through UKB
Doesn't consist of bulk data (microarray data, exomes, imaging, etc.)
raw_data/
 *.html - a visual index of what data we have access to
 *.csv - a csv of all the data in an enc file (too large for request 41414)
 *.enc - the enc files containing the data we requested
 *.key - the keys used to authenticate our requests
 *.enc_ukb - the unpacked enc files
 Two requests: 41414 and 29170
 Read below for an explanation of how these files were downloaded/produced
extracted_data/
 any data that was extracted from a enc_ukb file that isn't a full csv
 of all the data contained in it
scripts/
 helper scripts I've written
 scripts/output contains the output of the pbs scripts in scripts/
request_2020_march/
 contains the temporary files I generated while creating
 a list of data fields to request from the UKB administration at that date
all_fields.csv
  downloaded from some part of the showcase website
  that I didn't document

Extracting data from .enc files:
The instructions for downloading these are described here:
https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~bbdatan/Accessing_UKB_data_v2.1.pdf
(The accessing data guide here: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/exinfo.cgi?src=AccessingData)
in section 2
Only someone with the email from the original application
(i.e. Richard Yannicky in the Gymrek lab) can download the .enc file that is the
encoded file containing all of the data
The ukbunpack and ukbconv utilities can be used to generate the .csv (or other
datafiles from the .enc file

To do this:
cd to the directory with the .enc file, and set $UKB_UTILITIES to the 
appropriate directory.
Unpack the enc into a enc_ukb file by running:
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbunpack ukb29170.enc k29170.key
This will generate a ukb29170.enc_ukb file
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb docs -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the documentation for the dataset (ukb29170.html)
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb csv -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the csv
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb bulk -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
creates the bulk data file that's used to download
bulk data sets (such as the exome data BAM files)

The ukb29170.log and fields.ukb are generated as side effects of the above
commands

You can retrieve subsets of the data or output the data in different
formats using different options with ukbconv, see the linked PDF above
