The final set of samples will be:

all_samples
for keep_list in keep:
	all_samples = all_samples intersect keep_list
for remove_list in remove:
	all_samples = all_samples - remove_list

Note that remove/low_quality is a subset of remove/kinship_exclusion
(the latter also contains 9 ppts identified as poor quality due to 
having many more identified relatives than is possible)
