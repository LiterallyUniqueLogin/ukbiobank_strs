original HDL finemapping FINEMAP regions 1_219976499_220226499 and 20_55711040_55961040 seem to have the wrong p_val threshold (using variants with p_val >= 0.05). Others for HDL?
Check difference in first pass susie alpha v pip - PIPs have changed for some reason (but files are identical otherwise). Fix.
Check difference in followup pass graphs - different definition of regions. Still worth debugging, or do I assume this is working?
add susie mpv graphs?
How do we document changes to the figs and supplementary tables that won't be tracked with track changes?
Fig 3 and supp fig 13 Change discovery p-value to -log10(discovery p-value)
generate finemapped results table with support 2+ gene annotations instead of all gene annotations? Or if not, then need to say in methods.
Need to follow up on supp table 6

Regenerate supp fig 4 with only alphas from pure CSes

Images that still need to be WDL for new fine-mapping : 1c, supp figs 2
RHOT1 conditional manhattan?
CBL mean sphered cell volume association to conditional manhattan?
SLC2A2 association and manhattan?

Redo fine-mapping of regions containing duplicated STRs?:
^17\t80520458|^1\t247747217|^1\t247848392|^21\t47741815|^8\t145231731

TODO – uncovered 16287713 for mean corpuscular haemoglobin that has a low p-value and no fine-mapping from very old code and a high p-value and successful fine-mapping from new code. Worth double checking or nah? 

CBL - do we put in a reference to the less than stellar imputation statistics?

Discuss unrelatedness, standard GWAS practices and LMM methods in associaTR's docs.

Swap all association images for WGS images and change captions accordingly

CBL Shai's suggestion:
In megakaryocytes, CBL encodes c-CBL a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling43 by targeting the TPO receptor and additional downstream components of the signaling pathway to proteasomal degradation [PMID 19880496].  Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary regulator of megakaryocyte progenitor expansion and differentiation [PMID: 8578518] **I use a different citation by the same author here**. CBL mutations are rarely implicated in myeloproliferative disorders including essential thrombocythemia [PMID: 26182311 PMID: 24325359]. **I didn't think this was compelling and so removed this sentence** In mice, tissue specific loss of c-CBL function in megakaryocytes was associated with increased platelet count [PMID: 32954656].

References - done checking all!:
p1 par. 1 ref 2 - can we use something more recent than 13 years ago?
Most recent GWAS for height explains all of heritability, admittedly using hundreds of thousands of SNPs
What about something which still doesn't?

p1 par3 I would emove ref 8 - while its nice to have a reference
that discusses mechanisms, it doesn't explain "undergo frequent mutations" - it focuses on a very narrow subset of 
repeats and doesn't discuss frequency.

p1 par3 Do we want to add a separate section
here about methylation with the new paper Yang is working with? Could also use
"Polymorphic tandem repeats within gene promoters act as modifiers of gene expression and DNA methylation in humans"
in that section

p1 par3 - no reference for noncanonical RNA secondary structures - need one or remove claim.

p2 par1 -  reference 19 to 1000 genomes doesn't include STRs, but that's not directly because they're not part of microarray,
rather they tried and found lobstr insufficient.

Is it reasonable to assume that INDEL calling doesn't sufficiently represent STRs? If so, shoudl include UK10K reference panel
as a citation: https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9111#MOESM1094

I assert that STRs are often ignored even in GWAS from WGS data sets - need to back this up with citation

Change citation 35 (apo B is backbone of LDL C) - this shows it is backbone of VLDL particles, and in a way that's buried. Find
a better reference.

CBL - add new STR methylation paper as a citation?

The following statement needs a citation:
BCL2L11 in particular is pro-apoptotic and is required in the tightly regulated lifespan of myeloid lineage cells
Should we remove ref 48 increasing granulocyte counts?

Ref 52 - 17β-Estradiol decreases hypoxic induction  of erythropoietin gene expression - suggests that 
17beta-estradiol is involved with red blood cell counts. However, it never specifically mentions or looks at its binding to 
ESR2. Can that be presumed, or should this citation be cut?

Ref 53 - Best practices for benchmarking germline small-variant calls in human genomes - this shows that results 
are substantially worse in homopolymer regions, but doesn't make the claim that this one of the most difficult regions to genotype.
Do we care? Better reference, or smaller claim?
