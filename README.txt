This is the code repository for associaTR - performing associations between short tandem repeat lengths and phenotypes
Documentation for associaTR is coming soon.

This is also the code repository for the analyses and figures described in the paper:
Margoliash et al., Polymorphic short tandem repeats make widespread contributions to blood and serum traits
(on bioRxiv soon!)

README_dataset.txt contains details on the locations of the data that was used to run this analysis.
For those reading this online - most of this data is not present in the git repo and would need
to be accessed from the UKB after being granted an application.

README_analysis.txt contains details on the analysis done on those data files that produced the results
and figures for the aforementioned paper.
