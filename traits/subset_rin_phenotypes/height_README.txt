Subsetting to samples with phenotype that passed sample_qc, as denoted by the file: /expanse/projects/gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/sample_qc/runs/height/combined_unrelated.sample
Ranking phenotype. Tie breaks for equal ranks are arbitrary and stable.
Inverse normalizing phenotype ranks to the standard normal distribution via the transformation rank -> normal_quantile((rank + 0.5)/nsamples).
