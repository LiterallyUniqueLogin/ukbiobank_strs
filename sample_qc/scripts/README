Common filters were created with:
low_quality_list
sex_aneuploidy_list
sex_mismatch_list
white_brits_list
withdrawn_already
These use list_from_sample_qc

# low quality contains excessive PC-adjusted heterozygostiy, excessive (>200) relatives, and excessive missingess.
# This is the excluded.from.kinship.inference column in the sqc file
# The het.missing.outliers column in that file is a subset of this: the excess het, excess missing, and not the 9 excess relative samples
# The excess.relatives column refers to >10 putative 3rd degree relatives which includes cousins,
# and so doesn't seem excessive to me or warranting filtering. It is not the same as the 9 samples 
# with > 200 3rd degree relatives

Run combine.py to combine already created filters
Run unrelated_individuals to subset a sample list to its maximally unrelated subset
