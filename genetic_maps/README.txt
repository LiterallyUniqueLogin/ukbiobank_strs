This folder contains a build GRCh37 genetic map. 

The map was generated by lifting the HapMap Phase II genetic map from build 35 to GRCh37. The original map was generated using LDhat
as described in the 2007 HapMap paper (Nature, 18th Sept 2007). The conversion from b35 to GRCh37 was achieved using the UCSC liftOver 
tool.

Once the liftOver was completed, the map was inspected for regions in which the genome assembly had be rearranged. Such rearrangements
result in a dip in the lifted genetic map (i.e. a negative recombination rate). These regions were removed by setting the 
recombination to zero within, and for 50 SNPs either side of, such regions. These regions are fairly rare, and this method removed a 
total of 2013 SNPs from the following chromosomes.

chr1: 224 SNPs
chr2: 209 SNPs
chr3: 104 SNPs
chr4: 103 SNPs
chr7: 547 SNPs
chr9: 292 SNPs
chr10: 101 SNPs
chr13: 208 SNPs
chr15: 101 SNPs
chrX: 124 SNPs.

All other chromosomes did not have any SNPs removed by this method.
