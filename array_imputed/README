# doing this with multiple different chromosomes yields identical files,
# so chrom 1 is sufficient

Variants:
python fetch_imputed_files.py

confirmed that imputed variant bgens do not contain variants
genotyped by the original microarrays
Confirmed imputed variant bgens have the reference as the first allele
except for some errors in chromosomes 21 and 22 as identified
by confirm_first_allele_is_ref.py  
I don't know why the issues are so sporadic within those chroms
and are confined to those chroms, its possible I'm doing something wrong.
But looking at a genome browser for hg19 it looks like my script is working
and the variants in the imputed file are in fact wrong
the variants with problems were taken from the output of the python script
and copied into misrepresented_variants.txt
