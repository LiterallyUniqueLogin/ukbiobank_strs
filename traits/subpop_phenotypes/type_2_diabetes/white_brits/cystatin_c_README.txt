Loading categorical covar with field id 30722 from txt file  /expanse/projects/gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/main_dataset/extracted_data/cystatin_c_aliquot_30722.txt
Choosing phenotype value and age for each participant based on the first visit for which this phenotype had a recorded value. If the participant had this phenotype measured at multiple visits, only the phenotype value and age at the first visit are being used. The age is being loaded from the shared_covars file /expanse/projects/gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/traits/shared_covars/asssessment_ages.npy . An additional dummy covariate indicating visit number is being added for each visit whose data is used beyond the first.
No qc'ed samples of this ethnicity for which this phenotype was measured had value 4 for categorical covariate cystatin_c_aliquot,30722.
Using categorical covar cystatin_c_aliquot, default category when all dummy variables are False is 1
All samples have all covariates.
