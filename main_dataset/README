Extracting data from .enc files:
The instructions for downloading these are described here:
https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/~bbdatan/Accessing_UKB_data_v2.1.pdf
(The accessing data guide here: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/exinfo.cgi?src=AccessingData)
in section 2
Only someone with the email from the original application
(i.e. Jonathan Margoliash in the Gymrek lab) can download the .enc file that is the
encoded file containing all of the data
The ukbunpack and ukbconv utilities can be used to generate the .csv (or other
data files) from the .enc file

To do this:
cd to the directory with the .enc file, and set $UKB_UTILITIES to the 
appropriate directory.
Unpack the enc into a enc_ukb file by running:
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbunpack ukb29170.enc k29170.key
This will generate a ukb29170.enc_ukb file
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb docs -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the documentation for the dataset (ukb29170.html)
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb csv -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
generates the csv
$UKB_UTILITIES/ukbconv ukb29170.enc_ukb bulk -e$UKB_UTILITIES/encoding.ukb
creates the bulk data file that's used to download
bulk data sets (such as the exome data BAM files)

The ukb29170.log and fields.ukb are generated as side effects of the above
commands

You can retrieve subsets of the data or output the data in different
formats using different options with ukbconv, see the linked PDF above

If a data field isn't present in one of the enc files, try retrieving it from
the other. They contain different fields from different requests we made.
