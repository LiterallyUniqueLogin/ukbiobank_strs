Not sure how to download the csv file in this directory
Ask Richard
I think it comes from the application process to access UKB data

The csv file contains all the data

The fields file just lists the numerical name of all the columns
in the csv file. Each of these is just the data-field id (or sub-ID)
of a piece of data that can be looked up in the UKB showcase

I'm not sure what the .enc file is. Maybe it is a compressed form of the csv?
