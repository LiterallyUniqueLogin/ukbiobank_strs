Can't compare directly to the finemapping results we're using 'cause they use slightly different variants
(3 STRs which have p-val exactly 5e-4, many SNPs which my code filtered but we're no longer using
my code's filters)
So instead compare to tol_0.001 which is the default run anyway
All variants shared now

401 regions so far, need to exclude mean_platelet_volume_3_168523039_169284136 for the time being
48239 variants with p <= 5e-8: 45020 SNPs, 3219 STRs (6.6%)


Baseline: 419 CSes with a variant passing the p-val thresh and also min abs corr >= 0.8 from 296 regions
Recall: total CS pip is required to be >= .9 (this is not true once we p-val thresh the vars)
161 CSes have >= 95% PIP after p-val filter
208 CSes have 90-95% PIP after p-val filter (i.e. retain the original 90% threshold)
18 CSes have 80-90% PIP after p-val filter
13 CSes have 50-80% PIP after p-val filter
19 CSes have <50% PIP after p-val filter

Among p-val threshed variants in those CSes:
109 variants have PIP >= 90%, 8 are STRs
13 variants have 80-90% PIP, no STRs
43 variants have 50-80% PIP, 1 STR
69 variants have 35-50% PIP, 2 STRs
129 variants have 20-35% PIP, 11 STRs
973 variants have 05-20% PIP, 33 STRs
(STRs are 4.1% for PIP at least 5%, 7.3% for PIP at least 90%)
15 total CSes are attributable to STRs from the above
300 total CSes to SNPs

Diff with tol 0.0001:
All baseline CSes stay within +/-3% of previous
No alphas change by more than +/-2%
No new vars with >= 5% PIP

Diff with ratio 1.5:
1 baseline CS changes from 90% to 5% - this is mostly lost from many correlated SNPs
6 baseline CSes change between 10% and 5%
30 variables with changes 5%-20%, none above that. 21 are STRs. Single STRs account for 4 of the CSes that changed 5-10%, One such SNP accounts for another. 6th must be more incremental changes.
This still means that the rest of these STR's PIPs (~15) are being reallocated within their CSes without CS total changing:
A CS with little total alpha diff shifts 15% poitns to the top SNP, only half coming from two STRs, the rest from scattered SNPs

Total alpha loss is 210% - 160% attributable to STRs
Total alpha gain in new vars with >= 5% PIP - 414% - almost all attributable to SNPs

Diff with ratio 4:
1 baseline CS changes from 90% to 5% (same as above)
5 baseline CSes change between 10-20%
9 baseline CSes change between 5-10%
(this includes 4 of the 5 minor changes above, but one 7% change above becomes only a 3% change here)
1 STR loses 35%
7 STRs and a SPN lose in the 20-27% range
22 more in the 10-20% range, mostly STRs
31 more inn the 5-10% range, mostly STRs, STRs lose, SNPs gain or lose

Total alpha loss is 560% - about 5 and a half CSes
That is basically the same as the total alpha loss among STRs

Total alpha gain in new vars with >= 5% PIP - 384% - almost all attributable to SNPs

Diff with res var 0.95:
1 baseline CS changes from 90% to 5% (same as above)
That's it
About 10 vars lose in the 5-15% range explaining that CS

Diff with res var 0.8:
4 baseline CSes change by 85+% - 3 in the same region (yet unrepresented), plus the one above
That's it, nothing else above 5%
20 vars in the 5-25% explaining those CSes

Total alpha loss : 200%
Total new alpha gain: 285%

Diff with prior var 0.0005:
Literal zero change, CS or var

Diff with prior var 0.2:
Literal zero change, CS or var

Diff with hardcalls:
11 baseline CSes drop by 90+% (one from the trio from res var 0.8, not the reoccuring one above)
2 more 80-90% (the remaining 2 from the trio from res var 0.8)
2 more 50-80%
9 in the 10-30% range
50 in the 5-10% range
Var diff:

268 vars with >= 5% abs diff - 21 are STRs - total change for STRs is -0.3%
Summed (non abs) diff for those vars is -1,400% i.e. loss of about 14 and a half CSes
Sum over STRs is -0.3% - i.e. almost all loss comes from SNPs

Gain of 28 and a half CSes - 1.15% from STRs
