The contents of this directory (each directory has its own README):
array_imputed - the 90m genotypes imputed from the microarray chips
association - contains any code and results from association testing
exome - the UKB whole exome sequencing data. NOTE: this has been recalled
   and is only expected to be rereleased Spring 2020
genetic_maps - genetics maps for hg19 downloaded from Beagle, used during Beagle's phasing routine
main_dataset - contains the phenotypes we have access to through UKB
	Doesn't consist of bulk data (microarray data, exomes, imaging, etc.)
microarray - the 650k snp genotypes gathered by microarray chips
misc_data - miscellaneous small pieces of data associated with the larger datasets
	in the above folders, but located and downloaded separately
pre_imputation_qc: tests done before imputing STRs into the datasets
snpstr: Shubham's SNP-STR reference panel
str-imputed: the UKB genetic data after STR imputation
ukb_utilities - the utilities used to download all the data from the data showcase
