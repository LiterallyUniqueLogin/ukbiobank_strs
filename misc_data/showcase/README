Individual SNP genotype QC information
wget http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/auxdata/ukb_snp_qc.txt
Described here: http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=1955
Referenced here: http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/ukbgene_instruct.html

Correct ref/alt assignments per SNP:
wget -nd  biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/auxdata/ukb_snp_bim.tar
This file contains the correct ref and alt alleles for each SNP
The bgen hap files have permuted alleles which are more difficult to handle
