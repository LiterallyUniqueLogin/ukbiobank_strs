call individually vs call jointly - 175k STRs vs 750k STRs
100kbp vs 1mbp difference
TPM (Yang) vs RPKM (2019)? 
PEER from TPM vs RPKM?
20 vs N/10 PEER factors (>20 normally)
5 PCs vs 10 PCs

Yang - plotted his data - still looks like a good relationship

I'll make sure the rows that are omitted from the 2019 paper are for the two first rows
