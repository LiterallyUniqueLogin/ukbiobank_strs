Loading participant ID index and sex covariate. File: /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/microarray/ukb46122_cal_chr1_v2_s488282.fam, cols: (0, 4)
Adding PC covariates 1-40. File: /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/misc_data/EGA/ukb_sqc_v2.txt, cols: [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. Participants in same order as previous file.
Adding ages at assessments. File: /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/main_dataset/extracted_data/assessment_age.csv
Adding height phenotype, sampling visit and age at sampling visit. File: /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/main_dataset/extracted_data/height.txt. Only reporting first height measurement taken even if there were multiple at different vists
Filtering 0 height values that are taller than the world's tallest person or shorter than the shortest.
Adding age at height measurement as a covariate
Adding total_bilirubin phenotype and date of measurement, File: /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/main_dataset/extracted_data/bilirubin.csv. total_bilirubin is taken from the first assessment where it was sampled, if any.
Adding age at bilirubin measurement as a covariate
Subsetting to samples from file /projects/ps-gymreklab/jmargoli/ukbiobank/sample_qc/runs/height/combined_unrelated.sample.
